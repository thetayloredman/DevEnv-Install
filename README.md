# DevEnv-Install
Install all common NodeJS development libraries for any system with a Bash shell (OS X, *NIX, etc.)

## Running

To run and install my DevEnv, clone this repo and run 

```bash

chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh

```

## Why not sudo?

Node Version Manager (nvm) installs NodeJS locally, not system wide.
Only your user will have access to NodeJS unless other users also install
nvm.
