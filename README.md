# DevEnv-Install
Install all common development libraries for any system with a Bash shell (OS X, *NIX, etc.)

## Running

To run and install my DevEnv, clone this repo and run 

```bash

chmod u+x ./install.sh
sudo ./install.sh

```

## Why sudo?

`sudo` (NOT ROOT USER) is needed to install all dependencies.
